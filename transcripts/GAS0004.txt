 I understand that you've been having some diarrhea. Can you tell me a little bit about that? Yeah, sure. I've been having diarrhea for the past three to four days. And it's been pretty bad. I couldn't go to my classes. I had to skip because it was just embarrassing. OK, I'm starting to hear that. Have you had any things like this before? Have I ever experienced something like this before? I don't think so. OK. And over the three to four days, have your skills all been loose or have you had some solid ones in between? I think they've mostly been loose. I think they've all been loose, actually. But I think about it. OK, and how many times a day have you been having as a solid diarrhea? Oh my god. I've lost count. I'm going every hour. Maybe. OK, I have an hour. OK. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your stool? No, it's brown. OK. Any blood in your stool that you've noticed? Not really. I don't think so. I don't look that much, to be honest. OK. Have you noticed any pain associated with it? Well, I didn't start off with being, but I do have a bit of a cramp now since yesterday. It hurts sometimes. It comes and goes. OK. And do you feel that when it's, do you feel that you still have control over like releasing it, do like, does it come on? And then you don't even notice that it has happened or you still are able to kind of have a warning before you get to the toilet? No, I do get a warning, but it's just I do need to get to the toilet really fast. OK. And before this happened, have you noticed, have you, is there anything that you've done differently that you've been eating differently or any other changes that happened in your life recently? I did go to, I did go to a new restaurant five days ago. OK. What have you asked there? I just got some rice with chicken, chicken minjurian. It was a nice little Chinese restaurant. And yeah. Did anyone else have the same thing that you did that you were with? No, not really. I went with my friend and I haven't really haven't talked to her about this. I never really felt that these were related. This was related to that. And it's, you know, absolutely potentially not, like it's maybe not, it could possibly be. So not to worry you about that. We just, like to get an idea of kind of the whole picture of what you're coming in this. So in terms of the last three to four days, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting? Yeah. Yeah. I have actually, but it's not been as bad as the diarrhea. I didn't even, yeah, I wasn't even thinking about that. Yeah, I did vomit, I think twice yesterday. Okay. Have you noticed any blood in the vomit? No, it's just watery. Okay. And are you nauseated all the time or is it kind of on and off? It's on and off. Okay. Have you taken any, any over the counter medicine or anything to help? Not really. I was just trying to drink a lot of water because I know that I can get dehydrated. So just drinking water. Yeah, that's great. Okay. So let's good to hear. Have you, have you been eating normally or have you not been eating as much as you regularly? I have been eating less. Especially since yesterday when I had my disease abdominal cramps started. I just don't feel like eating. Okay. Is there anything that has been making it worse? Making what worse? Just in general, like, is there anything that you're finding, like your nausea or your diarrhea has come on? No, not really. I don't think so. Do you notice any changes to your urine or any discomfort when going to the bathroom? No. Okay. Have you traveled anywhere recently? No. Okay. Okay. And have you noticed any fever or chill? There's not a few days. I've just been feeling really tired and I don't know. Maybe I haven't checked my temperature. Okay. Have you noticed any rashes or changes in your skin? No. Okay. Do you notice any major changes to your weight? I know that you might not weigh yourself every day, but anything that jumps out to you? I actually haven't weighed myself in the past five days, so I don't know. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm just going to jump to you and your general history. Do you have any history of problems with your digestive system? No. Okay. Do you have any chronic conditions that you see if they're only doctor for regularly? I have asthma. Okay. Do you see any medications? Yeah. I've got some puffers that my family dog gave me. Okay. Nothing else? No. That's it. Okay. 28. 28. Are you okay? No. I don't. Okay. Okay. I have you. I have you. Are you surprised to see that again? Have you ever been hospitalized in the past? I haven't had wisdom teeth removed, but no, I wasn't hospitalized. I'm not. I'm not. Okay. Have you been in contact with anyone recently that's been sick? Nope. I don't think so. Okay. That's your living situation right now. You said you're a student? I am. Okay. Do you live on your own with family with roommates? I will give it to roommates. Do you drink alcohol? Sometimes. Okay. How many drinks per week would you say? I may have a glass or two on the weekends. Do you smoke? No. Okay. Do you use any other substances? Nope. Okay. And what would you eat on a regular day? Your typical diet. Oh gosh. Well, I like to have oatmeal for breakfast. I usually make something quick for lunch, maybe like a salad. And then I might have... I'll probably just eat out at night and maybe get a burger or fries or something. Okay. Cool. And I just wanted to jump over to ask you about your family history. Does anyone in your family have any history of digestive problems? I have some of the problems with abdominal surgeries. My brother had a bandisitis when he was young. My mom has had his direct to me. If that counts. Yeah. Nothing else. Okay. Okay. Thank you for sharing that with me. So I think that's everything that I wanted to ask you for today.
