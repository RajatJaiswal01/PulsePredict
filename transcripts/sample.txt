And how about any misalignment or, um, joint deformity? No. I don't see any of that. Okay. And are there any scars? No. Okay. And, um, when you press on, um, the medial part of the elbow, do you feel pain? I do. How about over the, um, electron or the, um, yeah, any pain over the electron on? Uh, a little bit. Okay.

Um, and how about, um, pain with pronation and, uh, supination? With pronation, it hurts. Okay. Okay. I have the medial side. Yes. Okay. And, um, how about with, uh, wrist? So with, uh, resisted, um, uh, yeah, wrist, uh, flexion. Rest flexion? Yeah. That hurts too. Okay. And then how about if you passively extend your, your wrist as far down as, as you can go down, as, as you can go down, uh, yes, that hurts too. Okay. Um, and is there any, uh, numbness or are tingling anywhere? Um, no, no, no numbness or tingling. Okay. Um, uh, okay. Um, so that was everything that I wanted to, um, ask about today. Um, was there anything else that you wanted to mention? No, that was it. What do you think I have and how can I fix it? Yeah. So it, um, certainly it, it sounds like with the medial aspect of your elbow, um, having pain there last several months and so the physical exam maneuver, such as like passive, uh, wrist extension, resisted, wrist flexion as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow. There's could be a, uh, medial, um, epicon delitis, um, or, uh, a tendon opathy, um, in that area. And so this is typically treated with, um, activity modification. So this could be, uh, trying to avoid repetitive movements that, that cause pain, um, and using medications such as, um, advellant Tylenol, um, and doing strengthening and stretching exercises, which you can, um, learn from, uh, physiotherapists or, or, um, on, on your own as well. Um, and also, uh, other things that the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar, uh, ligament injury, um, or, uh, yeah, or the other thing to be considering is an ulnar ligament injury. Um, and so if the pain isn't going away, then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures, um, there. Okay, that sounds great. Thank you.
