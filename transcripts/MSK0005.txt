Uh, no, I haven't been around anybody who's been sick. Okay. Any recent travel? I've been at home. Um, I think those are all the questions that I had for you. And did you have any questions of your own for myself? Uh, no. Well, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow. Yeah. So right now it seems like you may have a case as something called, um, lateral epicon delitis. Um, so it's also known as, um, tennis elbow. Um, and there are a lot of things I could kind of predispose you to this. Um, so it could be like the repetitive strain at work. Um, and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor, muscle group there. Um, so for this, we basically recommend, um, a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh, but first, uh, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma. And I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um, so to help you treat this, um, we recommend some activity modification. So, um, at work, not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those, um, extensor forum muscles. And then you can use some, uh, use the compressions sleeve as well. Continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain. And, uh, really important is physical therapy, um, to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh, and as well, you can apply things like ice, um, to it for, like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most. Uh, but normally it does, um, go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the, the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds, um, good. Thank you. Yeah, always.
