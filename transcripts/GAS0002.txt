 I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in to the emergency department today. Yeah, so nice to meet you. I've been having this pain right in my abdomen. It's kind of like in the upper right area. Okay. And so where is this pain located exactly? So it's just in the upper right corner of my abdomen right below where the lungs are. And yet it just has the severe pain that's going on. Okay. And how long has it been going on for? So it's been going on for the last few days and it got worse today. Okay. And how long has it been since it's like got worse. Is it a bit a few hours or how long has that been? So I would say it got worse just three or four hours ago before I came to the emergency department. Okay. And does the pain radiate anywhere? No, it stays right in the spot that I told you right in the right upper corner. Okay. And when did the pain start? Or if you could tell me what were you doing right prior to the pain starting? So I think it started after just three days ago after I had a meal. Like I think it was after lunch around half an hour or an hour after lunch. I see. Okay. It has the pain. Gone worse. Stayed the same or gone better since, since yesterday. I think it's gone. It was. It's the worst today, like especially like a few hours ago, like three hours ago. It was much worse than the other two days. Okay. And how would you describe the character or the quality of the pain? So it's like a sharp or describe it as like a sharp pain. Okay. And on a scale of one to ten, ten being the most severe pain, what would you rate it as? I would rate it as right now. I'd rate it as an eight. Okay. And has anything like this happened to you before? I think it happened to me a few years back where I had this pain and then it just kind of went away on its own. I didn't go to the emergency department then though. Okay. And has there been anything that you've tried to make this pain any better? I tried taking just like Advil and Tylenol, but it didn't really seem to help the pain too much. Okay. And have you had any other associated symptoms such as nausea or vomiting? I've had some nodule over the past few days when I've been vomited or anything. Okay. So no blood in your MSS or no vomiting at all? Yeah. Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently? No. Like we haven't traveled anywhere recently. Okay. And how has your energy levels been? Energy, when it's hurting a lot like today, it's been difficult to move around. Been pretty drained from the pain. But otherwise over the last few days it hasn't affected me too much. But today I would say my energy levels are down. Okay. And have you noticed any skin changes or any rashes? I don't think so. I mean, I don't think I've noticed any kind of skin changes. Okay. And how about any changes to urinary habits like painful urination or the color of your urine? No. No changes. Okay.

No. No blood. Okay. And how has your appetite been? It was around the same before the pain actually started getting worse. So today I didn't really feel like eating.

And have you had any recent infections? No. Not that I know. No. Okay. So next just to ask some questions about your past medical history.
