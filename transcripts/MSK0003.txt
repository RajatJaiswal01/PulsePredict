So definitely what so this seems like it started like three months to six months ago and it's been going on and it's happening in the morning and how old did you say you were? I'm 2026. Okay. Yeah. So in the teams progressive and you're getting some pain and your other joints as well. It's mainly from your middle to lower back. It can be multiple things that you would have to rule out. So first you have a family history of psoriasis. So it can be psoriasic arthritis. You don't have any other skin changes or any other symptoms. It can also be since you have had a you were sick four months ago with what might be gastroenteritis. It can be sometimes a few months afterwards you can get something called the active arthritis where you get this progressive pain in your joints and stiffness. And otherwise it can also be something called antolysis fondolitis which can present in your age and it's kind of like a progressive dull back pain and that has some morning stiffness as well. So yeah, there's definitely multiple things that it can be. So first we would need to do a full physical examination and book an appointment for that in person. And we will get some lab work done as well as well as an x-ray of the spine and your sacral iliac joints. And we'll also get some blood work with CBC, CRP and ESR. So those are just inflammatory markers as well as the rheumatoid factor and can you clear antibodies. So there are some things that will test for different kind of rheumatological issues to see if you have any arthritis. So yeah, those are, and then we'll also get an x-ray of your hands and knees since you're having pain there as well. So yeah, those are some steps that will take, do you have any questions or concerns? No, that sounds great. Thank you. All right, so we'll get in touch with you shortly. That's great. Thank you. All right, take care. Bye. Bye.
