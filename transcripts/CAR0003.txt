So based on what we talked about, uh, from your swelling, as well as, uh, breathlessness, uh, while laying down in your past history, uh, of a heart attack and, uh, high cholesterol, it may be likely with the medications you're on, uh, as well as your history that you might be having. What's called a congestive heart failure? So, uh, we will need to do further investigations, um, to determine if this, that is what it is in, and if we need to get you on something like, um, like, basics or a diuretic to get rid of some of the fluid, um, that's building up in your body, which may be caused by heart failure. So we'll do some investigations and then, uh, go from there.
