 That will bring you to clinic today. Hi, so I feel like I might have a bladder infection. I see a urologist because I've had some issues with like an overactive bladder for a while. I've had a few bladder infections in the past and this is usually how how they feel. I feel like a little bit of burning when I go to the bathroom and I have to go like a lot right now. But then also sometimes it means that like it gets like this when I have my period. And I don't have my period right now but I you know I could be getting it but I also just don't want to let it go. Keep going if I do have an infection. I'd just like rather get it treated if I do. Okay, understood. When was your last period? Like two weeks ago? About two weeks ago. Are you fairly regular? Like yes and no. And I'm not super irregular but I sometimes have like it basically it's like I alternate. Sometimes I my cycle's like four weeks and sometimes it's more like five. Sorry, just clarify again. Your third year's old? Yeah, I'm 30. Okay. Are you going to go contraception right now? Uh no, I'm not. Okay, are you sexually active at all? No. No, okay. So just in terms of your you're in a retract infections, what was your last one? Uh I had one like three months ago maybe. Three months ago? Okay, and if prescribed you antibiotics and it went away fairly quickly? Yeah, yeah, I went away. Like I always I always have no reactive bladder and I always have to go pretty frequently. Like every hour sometimes half hour but uh so that's still there but like it hasn't since then I haven't had any like pain. Okay, so you still have quite a you have a quite a bit of urgency to go. Um kind of keep getting more frequently but I suppose the new thing that you're a little bit concerned about is that it burns a little bit, stings a little bit when you do yearning. Am I understanding correctly? Exactly, like for the past couple days it's felt like that. Okay, has it been getting progressively worse at all? Um maybe a little bit. I feel like now I can recognize it's pretty early when it's not too bad to kind of get ahead of it. Okay, understood. And do you have any pain kind of behind your ribs at all? On your back? So I can repeat that? You haven't had any pain on your back, middle back kind of close to your ribs, have you? Not that I can think of. Okay, and have you noticed any changes to the quality of the year? Oh, uh, for example, is it frothy or smelled bad? It maybe looks like a little cloudy. Um, but nothing nothing else out of the ordinary like I've never had blood in it or anything. Understood. Have you noticed any visual changes in the area? Here for Jaina? No, not that I can see anything like that. Anything concerned for an STI that you're worried about? No, and like I haven't had a sexual partner in a few years. I'm understood.

For example, when you wipe with tissue paper, can you feel that well? Oh, yeah, I can feel everything. Okay, and no changes to your poops, to your bowel movements? No, it's a pretty normal. Okay, and how do you feel otherwise? Oh, I mean, I feel I feel a little tired. I felt like a little hot yesterday. I don't have a thermometer, so I didn't take my temperature. But sometimes I feel a little hot like when I've had the infections before. Okay, you don't have any swelling on your anywhere on your body, on your ankles, do you? No. No? Okay. And then so no puffiness around your eyes that you've noticed? No, I don't like that. Any rashes or any changes on your face?

No. Okay. And then in regards otherwise, you feel a little flushed, a little tired. Any other medical issues that you have? No, just this like overactive bladder thing. Okay. And have they given you any medications for it? We tried a few different ones before and now I get, I get Botox injections into the bladder like maybe twice a year. Anything else they've used recently? Like any medications you're on right now, I suppose? No, nothing, no, nothing else. Yeah, I guess I have like, I have an inhaler, but I don't use it all the time. Like I haven't had too many. Oh, so you have asthma? Yeah, like I honestly don't feel like I have it very much now, but I still have, like I still have seen you learn. Understood, understood. Anything else you've taken medications for in the past? Oh, I used to take birth control like the pill, but like I just, I don't have a boyfriend right now, and I didn't really feel like I needed it otherwise. Understood, understood.

No, nothing like that. Got it, got it. Okay, I think what now I'll do next, I'll move to a physical exam. I think we might just do some investigations just in order to get some more information. And then the physician will come in to see you, okay? Okay. Well, thank you. I'll be right on.
