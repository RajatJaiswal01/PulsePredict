 So your sister is going off, how old is she? She's 25. And if she goes to do a job, she's going to travel. She's going to work when she's there and do like bits of jobs and a move around. That same type. So is she going straight to Australia? No, first she's going to Thailand and then she's going to Australia. And then New Zealand. And then America. So she's brought one of these new tickets you can go around the world in a year or something. Is that what she's done? Yeah. So would you like to travel? Maybe one day. This has quite fun. So you're doing GCSEs? Spanish. Because I saw that it was the easiest one. That's good of a reason. Actually I think it probably is because I know it sounds straightforward but you can sort of add ease and taste. It's on the end of things. Nobody sounds right anyway. Because Spanish people are working with us at the moment. So this is a two year course now. Is it GCSEs? Yeah. 11. So you don't actually do exams this year but you do them next year. So you're 15 then? Yeah. So where are you going shopping tomorrow? To Ileman Broadway. Alright. You're shopping second. No you're looking for anything in particular or you're just going shopping. We're going to sleep over. But all four of you are going to sleep in one house. Yeah. Does that not cause... That's a problem. And not really. Alright. Because make sure that you sleep downstairs. So there's that really. Right. So you can't probably have your own imagine. Yeah. What about your dolls? I still do that but I do it less now. Because I still give them that up. So what do you do? It's sort of regularly or re-requitive. I do it on Wednesdays and on Thursdays now. Alright. So you're still doing it twice a week? Yeah. And you show those things you still do? I might be doing this. I'm not sure if I'll... Because I'm an amazing exam. Schoolwork and things. And how we work are taking up quite a bit of time. Right. When will we last see you last summer, wasn't it? Yeah. Last August. Did you go anywhere last summer? Yeah. We did. We went to... Do you island for... I can't remember. Alright. We went to... Purser. I think we went to Kilkenny. Alright. Yeah. You must have gone to Duffinay. No. We stayed down in the west. So did you fly or were you driving? We got the boat. And we took our car. I'm waiting for the boat to go from. It's one seat. Yeah. You're not thinking of me as to something either. Did you enjoy it? Yeah. It was really fun. I would like to ride it last summer. We'll ride this year. You're going anywhere this year? We're not sure. This Christmas we might go to New York to meet up with my sister. On my way back from Australia. And is she going to do anything? She would just do anything. Any kind of job or she, she doesn't. Yeah. She can back in our school because she's got the qualifications for it. Have you got relatives in Australia? Yes. I do. My son went to say he traveled around the world. Thailand and Australia. He ended up working on a sheep farm. Australia. He ran it up the sheep on a motorbike. Okay. Do you want to press the orange button again for?
