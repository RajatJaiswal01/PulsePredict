 nice to meet you. What's your name? My name's Scott. It's nice to meet you too. All right. So Scott, how old are you? I'm 15. 15? Okay. What brings you in today? I've had a sore throat now for a couple of weeks and it's just not going away. A couple of weeks. Okay. So about two weeks, three weeks. Yeah, about two to three weeks. Okay. What does it feel like? Is it kind of like a burning feeling? Is it more like an itchy feeling? What does it feel like? I would say it's kind of, yeah, like burning or burning or scratchy. Okay. And does it hurt when you swallow? It does, yeah. My throat hurts when I'm eating or swallowing it like liquids as well, but cold stuff seems to make it feel a little bit better. Okay. Good. And does your neck hurt too? A little tender. I've noticed the some lumps at the front of my neck that have been a bit sore. Okay. And isn't mostly sore kind of like midline or is it more sore to one side versus the other? I'd say maybe the right side is a little bit more sore, but I can feel it on both sides of my neck. Okay. And how bad would you say your discomfort is 1 to 10, 10 being the worst? I would say maybe a two or three. If I move my neck, I can feel it more, but otherwise I can just barely notice that it's there. Okay. So it's not preventing you from sleeping, going to school, playing things like that. No, it's more so the sore throat when swallowing. Okay. Okay. Have you noticed a fever at all? I have. Yeah, I felt hot and I checked my temperature this morning and it was 38.7. I think it was. Is that a fever? Yeah, I'd say that's a fever. We can also do another temperature check today. Okay. Yeah, but that definitely sounds like a fever. Have you noticed rashes anywhere? Yeah, I've had this, this like red, I guess pink rash that I have noticed. It's come over my chest and and and belly area. Okay. How big is it? Is it more than a centimeter? Yeah, it's pretty well. I mean, it's kind of spread out over an area like it's not all continuous, I guess. You can kind of see patches or blockers. Okay. And is it raised? No, it's not raised. Okay. Okay. Is it itchy? No, it's not itchy. Okay, painful. No, not painful. Okay. And is it bleeding or using anything like pus? No, it's not. Nothing like that. It's just pink and red and it's just kind of showed up over the last little while. I've noticed it on my like hands a little bit too. Okay. And you said the started when like was this before the sore throat or after? I can't remember the onset. I think the the sore throat started first and the rash came a little bit later. Okay. Okay. And have you noticed that your that your glands are swollen? I think so. Maybe that's what's swollen in my neck. Okay. Okay. How about coughing? No, I haven't had a cough. No. And how about a stepping nose or a runny nose? Nothing like that. Okay. Body aches. Yeah, I felt some muscle aches for sure. Okay. Upper limbs or lower limbs? I'd say it kind of whole body. I just feel like my muscles and joints are sore. Okay. Yeah. And do you have any headaches? No, I haven't really had any headaches. No. Okay. And how's your appetite? Are you still eating well? It might be a little bit down. I just kind of haven't been feeling so great. So I'm probably eating less the last few weeks. Yeah. Have you been around anyone who may have been sick recently? Yeah, actually, I think a few of my friends are there was somebody in my gym class who decided they had similar symptoms. Okay. Okay. And when was this? I don't know if you think about it. Probably about three or four weeks ago. Okay. And were they ever treated for that? Did they see a doctor? I'm not sure. No. Okay. No worries. I just remember them being off for school because they were sick. Okay. Yeah. Any issues with your eyes? No. No. Nothing like crusting or pus coming out of your eyes, red eye, anything like that. No. Well, they have looked maybe a little bit more red than usual, but I haven't noticed anything in terms of itchiness or discharge. Okay. Any nausea or vomiting? No. No, no, no. No, no. No, no. I'm not sure. Okay. How about your stool? Have they been normal? Have you had diarrhea, constipation, anything like that? No changes to bowel habits? Okay. How about urine? That's been okay. Okay. Okay. Have you ever had these symptoms before? I mean, I've had sore throats in the past, but not while feeling like this, though. Yeah. Okay. When was the last time you had a sore throat? I don't know. Maybe when I was a kid. Okay. It's been a while. Yeah. Like a strep throat kind of thing or more viral. Yeah. Do you remember getting antibiotics when I was younger? Okay. Okay. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any medical conditions? I was diagnosed with asthma. Okay. And are you on any medications for that? Um, yeah. So I just use a Ventalin as needed, but otherwise, oh, and then I take a flowbed daily. So, um, I think that's the one. There's a couple of inhalers that I take. Okay. Okay. And any other medications? Um, sometimes I'll take, um, like reactant or some other type of allergy pill, but, um, that's it. Okay. What are you allergic to? Well, I would say like mostly seasonal allergies, but we like, um, yeah, like seasonal allergies and dust, maybe. Okay. And, um, are you up to date with all your immunizations? Yeah. My mom makes me get the flu shot every year. Okay. Good. Um, and okay. Have you seen another doctor for the symptoms at all? Have you been worked up for that? Any blood work testing done for it already? No, I thought I would have felt better by now. And so I haven't seen anybody, but it's kind of just been, uh, going on now, not seeming to get better. Okay. Want to see somebody? Yeah, for sure. Um, have you tried anything for your symptoms, any medications, anything over the counter? Uh, yeah, I've tried some Tylenol and it's, uh, I think what is it, Advil? Um, and that definitely has helped with, um, uh, some of the kind of aches and pains, um, but they've come right back. Um, okay. Um, any family history of, uh, lung issues, heart issues? Um, no, nothing like that. No. Yeah. Okay. Have about cancers. Uh, I think my grandfather had, um, a pancreatic cancer. Okay. Okay. Um, all right. So, do you live at home, correct? Yeah, I live with my parents and my, uh, younger sister. She's 12. She's 12. Is she healthy? Yeah, she is. Okay. Good. And, uh, have you guys traveled recently? Uh, no, we've been, we've been at home. Okay. Okay. Um, and, uh, do you smoke? No, I don't smoke. Um, how about marijuana? Um, I've tried it once or twice, but, um, but I was, uh, just those couple of times. Nothing that I do or use regularly. Okay. Um, and how about alcohol? No, no alcohol. No alcohol. Okay. Um, are you, uh, sexually active? Um, no, I'm not. No. Okay. Um, is there a possibility that, uh, or actually, sorry, I should replace it. Have you kissed anyone recently? Uh, I, well, I guess I kind of have a girlfriend now. Um, that, and I started hanging out with about two months ago. Okay. Okay. Um, so I guess yes. Okay. All right. Well, that's good. Um, I have, has she had any of these symptoms? Uh, well, she, she was, it wasn't feeling well for a, uh, a while back, but, um, I don't think it was this bad for her. Okay. And she, and she's better now. Yeah, she's better now. Okay. Um, all right. So, uh, you mentioned your not sexually active. Uh, if you were to be, um, make sure you use protection. Um, and, uh, okay. So, uh, everything at home is okay then. Um, no one's, no one's sick at home. You mentioned, right? Yeah, no one's, no one's sick at home. Um, and school is going okay. Uh, yeah, school's been been going okay for the most part. It's been tough. These last few weeks feeling like this though. Yeah, for sure. And are you and your girlfriend in, uh, in an exclusive relationship? Uh, I, I think so, yeah. Okay. I asked because there's something called what you may be familiar with. Um, it's called the kissing disease. Um, in medical terminology, it's called mono as caused by a virus called eBV. Um, so it could be that. So we're covering all our bases. Oh, I've heard of mono before. Yeah. Okay. Um, it's likely I could be up there. Um, in terms of what you have. So, um, I think those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions for me? Anything you wanted to add? Um, no, I think that's, uh, you covered everything. Okay. All right. So, uh, we'll, we'll go off, uh, a few, we'll try to cover our bases and get you tested for mono, which you, uh, you'd have to do like a mono spot test and we can do, um, a rapid strap test as well. The sepia has something called strep throat. Um, but yeah, we'll see what those results come back as and we'll go from there. Does that sound good? Yeah. Oh, that sounds good. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
