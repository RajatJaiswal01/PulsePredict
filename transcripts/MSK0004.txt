No, I was able to kind of finish the I just finished the lock. I was able to lock home because it didn't hurt that bad immediately. It was a bit painful but the pain really started a few hours later and has been pretty much constant ever since. Okay. Okay so it kind of got worse over time over the last day. Mm-hmm. Yeah and do you notice any kind of bruising, redness, falling, any skin changes? No I haven't really noticed really any swelling or or skin changes. Yeah, no skin changes and no swelling. Okay and how would you describe the pain? Is it like a dull aching pain or a sharp stabbing pain? Dull and achy. Okay and as this happened to you and your ankle before? I feel like I've done something like this when I was younger maybe playing basketball or something like this when I was a kid. Yeah I've twisted my ankle before. Okay and does this pain just stay in, where's the pain exactly on the right side of your ankle or on your left like interior side? It's on the right kind of outside of the ankle. Okay and which ankle is this just to clarify? Oh sorry, on the right ankle. Okay so onto it hurts on the right side of the right ankle. Yeah exactly. Okay and does the pain radiate or move anywhere left in your feet? I can kind of feel it around on the sole of my foot as well but mostly on that outside though. Okay and is there anything that makes the pain better or worse? It gets worse really if I move my ankle or if I'm standing on it. Okay and anything that makes it better? Just if I rest and avoid moving it. Okay have you noticed any fevers or chills? No. Okay any pain in any other joints besides your ankle? No just my right ankle. Okay any appetite or weight changes? No I've been just training for this race coming up so I mean I've been just trying to work on my fitness a little bit but my weight's been relatively stable. Okay any weakness in your right right extremities or any kind of numbness or tingling sensation? No numbness or tingling and no muscle weakness either. Okay. All right have you diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past? I had diarrhea a few months ago and I was given a fluoroquine alone as an antibiotic. Okay so those two months ago? Okay and any medications that you're on currently? I take vitamin D and some other vitamins to and vitamin A as well I guess to just help my skin and then the vitamin D for my bones. Okay any allergies to any medications or any environmental issues? No allergies no. Okay any hospitalizations or previous surgeries? No. Okay any family history of any musculoskeletal conditions, any rheumatological conditions, anything that you know of? My grandparents have arthritis and my dad had had gall before. Okay and do your grandparents have rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis? You know? I think osteoarthritis. Okay and do you currently work? I do yeah I work as a software engineer. Okay and what's your living situation like currently? Right now I'm actually just living alone in an apartment. Okay and do you smoke it all? No never I can't with with all this like training for the race and stuff like that. Okay that's good. Any recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything like that before? No I've never used anything like that in the past. Okay and how about alcohol? I rarely I'll have maybe an asoon like once every couple of months but it's pretty infrequent. Okay all right so I just have a few questions. So right now where you're right ankle do you have so you mentioned you don't have any swelling but do you notice any kind of redness or warmth at all? No nothing like that. Okay and if you press down on your ankle does it hurt a lot? I a little bit of pain on it right. I would side but it's not wait it doesn't hurt that bad. So no it's not. Yeah I'll say no. Okay and if you kind of are you able to move your ankle at all? I can yeah I can move it around a little bit. I'm trying to avoid that though just because it does hurt but I can move it around. Okay and are you able to stand up and walk or are you not able to do that right now? I can yeah just short periods of time because it's just as of the pain but I can walk on it. Okay um yeah so definitely what we'll do is we might need to get like a proper physical examination done to make sure there's no fracture. Most likely though it seems that this may just be an ankle sprain and due to you inverting your ankle the other day. What we can do is usually we just immobilize the ankle and then recommend applying ice. You can take some and says like add those for pain to help you and it should get better on its own with some physiotherapy later on as well. However if we find that on physical examination you are having significant pain on palpation or any kind of bony pain we might also require you to get an x-ray of the right foot and ankle as well as just your lower leg. So yeah we'll have you come come in in person and then go from there and see if you need an x-ray. Okay that sounds good thank you. All right take care. Bye.
