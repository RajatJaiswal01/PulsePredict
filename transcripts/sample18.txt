 Exciting things. At the moment, I'm on vacation in Honduras. I'm on Rohiton Island, scuba diving for the next week. So far, the diving has been fantastic. I've gotten my advanced certification and also certification in enriched air diving, nitrox. My return to San Francisco will be working on several new exciting things. At the moment, our two new teachers, Kristen and Chris, are working on new lesson albums. Kristen and I are finishing the movie lessons. As you know, my effortless English club lessons include two sample movie lessons. In these lessons, you have the text from a real Hollywood movie. For each scene, there's also a vocabulary lesson. I explain difficult phrases, especially idioms and slang. Then there is a listen and answer mini story lesson or more than one. This is the most powerful lesson. In the mini story, we ask a lot of questions while telling a story. You answer the questions. As you hear the questions and answer them, you effortlessly learn vocabulary and grammar, and you learn them deeply. Some lessons sets also include a point of view lesson in which we tell the same story using different grammar, past, future, etc. Kristen and I are working on a core fluency lesson album. These lessons focus on the most common English words, phrases, and grammar. When you finish these lessons, you will master the most common English, allowing you to speak easily to native speakers. The core fluency lessons will be great for learners who want to strengthen their fluency or for learners who are lower level. The movie lessons will be a great addition to my effortless English club lessons. You will continue to improve while learning more idioms and common American slang. So continue to check this blog for more news about the new lessons. Meanwhile, the best way to get started is with my effortless English lessons. Enjoy English!
