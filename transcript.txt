Good morning, please have a seat here. What's the problem? I have a terrible stomach ache. Do you have diarrhea? Yes I do. Do you have any other symptoms? Yes I feel sick. You mean you feel nauseous? That's right, I feel like vomiting and right now I feel dizzy too. When did the symptoms start? This morning. Yesterday evening I ate something raw. Alright, please take off your clothes to the waist and lie down there. Just tell me if it hurts when I do this. It doesn't hurt. Ouch! It hurts there. Okay, let's hope it's just indigestion but we'll need to run some diagnostic tests to be sure. We'll run a blood test and we'll also need a urine sample. Can you give me something for the time being? Yes, I'll give you a prescription for indigestion tablets.
