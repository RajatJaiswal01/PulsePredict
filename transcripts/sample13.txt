 You're popping off to you've been here. Your dad's gonna be with you. So he's gonna know what you're gonna do. You're gonna find it. Well, we'll go back to our home first. I'll see you in a minute. You were going shopping in... Where's your nearest shopping shop? Ealing. Alright, yeah. So you must have some idea what you're gonna do. He's been hinting on a few things, like as I am game that he wants. And he's like that. It's not a game. It's a military one for the PlayStation. Alright, yeah. Yeah. I'll be game. What? So you're thinking like it that? I might do. I'll see. You might get a surprise. Yeah. What did you get in the last year? I can't remember now. I don't know. He just came. Anybody asked you. Probably a city. A city of Christophe. And your niece is coming tonight. Yeah. Because our member is quite young. Yeah, she's three. Alright. And that's your sister's daughter. No, it's my brother's. Brother's daughter. Yeah. And where does your niece live normally? She lives in St. Orbans. Alright. So they're all coming down tonight. And the other thing. Your sister's just coming tomorrow? Yeah. And where's that from? She lives in St. Orbans. Alright. Okay. So both your brother and your sister live in St. Orbans? Oh no. But my brother lives in Amphilt. Amphilt is living in St. So it opens here. Both living in Auckland. Yeah. Somewhere around there. And what will you do with your niece tonight? Um. How old is she? She's three. Right. That's good age. And she's kind of hyper. So. So you'll be giving your brother a bit of a rest. Yeah. Uh-huh. And is that your only niece or nephew? Yeah. So far. So far. Uh-huh. We think there might be more. Yeah. I think my sister wants to have a baby. So sometimes soon. And you're the youngest? Yeah. I am. How old are your brother and sister? Um. My brother's 30. And my sister's 27. Okay. And you're now 18? 17. 17. Not quite. No. In November. Right. Can't wait. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of. And the course is going well? Um. Yeah. So far. And we'll be specialising soon. Yes. So we're sort of trying to find out what we want to do. Which is kind of hard. I was just going to say you've got any idea what you want. You've got specialising in your second year. Yeah. And that would mean perhaps something unlike text sound design or printing or something like that. That sort of area. Uh-huh. And then there's a bit of photography. It'd be interesting. I think I was going to do a thing I'd do photography. Is that an option? Um, yeah. You can do that. I don't know what, what are they? I'm actually stuck. Tell me what you're using for your genetic engineering project. Um, today I've been trying DIP Pen, which is working quite well. It's kind of like ink. And use bleach and stuff to create different effects. Kind of. Sounds like a question. Uh-huh. So it's free hand drawing. Um, yeah. With a pen. I think. Yeah. And bleach. Uh-huh. That's interesting. So what would you do? You draw a picture, basically, with the pen. And then use bleach to give it different effects. Yeah. It kind of makes it go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be looking. And if you can't, interesting. You're just experimenting. You're not sort of. At the moment, I am. Because I don't know what to use for it, yeah. And how long have you got? Um, two weeks. So. I'm going to hand it in after when you can't have a filter. Yeah. Uh-huh. Are you?
