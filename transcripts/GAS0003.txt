 what brings you in here today? Yeah, hi. I'm... I have a pain in my belly. It started a couple hours ago. Okay, and where exactly in your belly do you have this pain? It's mostly up here on the right side. On the right side? Yeah. And can you describe what kind of pain is it? Is it like a dollopene, a sharp pain, an aching pain? I guess it's an aching pain, I'd say. It would initially just come and go, but now it's just staying. It's not going away. Okay. And so it's in the right area. And does it travel anywhere else where besides it all from the right side? No. Okay. And on a scale of one to ten, one being the least amount of pain you're felt in your life and ten being the worst. How much would you rate it right now? It's about an aching. An aching? Okay. So just to clarify, when did it start? So about eight hours ago? Eight hours ago. Okay. And were you doing anything before? Like did you have a meal or how were you asleep and it woke you up? What was going on before you had the pain? I was just about to go to sleep. I wasn't doing anything in the dick ever at the time. Okay. Has it been getting worse since it first started? Oh yeah. You definitely. It would come and go, but now for the past five to six hours, it's been constant. It's just there all the time. Okay. And have you had any similar pain like this in the past? Yeah. I have the same pain that sort of comes and goes after I eat. Usually after I've had something like a something fatty, something from outdoors, maybe like a burger or fries or something. I initially thought it was indigestion, but I don't know what's going on now. And does anything make it better or worse? Anything that you've tried? Well, I guess eating sometimes makes it worse. But I don't think there's anything that's making it better. Okay. Have you tried any medication at all? I tried Tylenol, but that didn't do anything. Okay. And besides the pain that you're having, do you have any nausea and vomiting? I am a little nauseous, but no, I haven't, I haven't vomiting yet, no. Okay. And have you been having any fevers? I don't think so. I haven't checked. But I don't feel feverish. Any sweats or like chills? No. I don't think so. Okay. Any changes in your bowel movements, like constipation diarrhea? No. Okay. Have you traveled anywhere recently? No, I haven't. Have you been feeling at all very tired, not your usual self, fatigue? Well, the pain is making you difficult for me to do things. But I guess I'm not a little fatigued, baby. Okay. Have you been having any changes in your urinary patterns? No. No. Any changes in your skin, any rashes, any yellowing of your skin? Nothing that I've noticed. No, I don't think so. Okay. Any changes in your urine color? No. Okay. Have you noticed blood in your stool at all? I have not. No. Okay. And how about your appetite? Has this changed at all? Well, I guess because the pain happens, usually happens after I eat, I think I've been eating less than usual. Just because I don't want to. You know, I don't like the pain. Okay. Any significant weight loss recently? I don't think so. Any recent infections recently at all? No. And otherwise, are you, do you have any other medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure or anything else? I do have diabetes, but that's about it, I think.

No. Any environmental allergies? No. No, I don't. Okay. Have you been hospitalized in the past? No. No, haven't ever. I've been very, I've been healthy. No hospitalizations. Any past surgeries? I got my vicinity removed when I was a teenager. Okay. Have you been in contact with anyone who has been ill recently? No. Why don't you so? Okay. And in terms of your family history, has anyone had any cancers or any irritable, any irritable, IED, like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis? No. Not that I know of. Okay. Anything that runs in the family at all? My dad had a heart attack when he was in his 60s. That's it. And currently right now, do you work? No, I'm lead off because of COVID. Okay. And currently, what is your home situation like? What do you mean? So, do you live in an apartment, a house, and do you live with anyone? I live in an apartment. I live alone. Okay. And in terms of your daily routine, you feel that you get an exercise, do you fall inside the walks or runs, anything like that? I usually go out for a run, especially when it's a little bit warmer, which it now is. And do you drink alcohol? Sometimes. Okay. How much would you say you drink in an average week? I wanted to drink a day. Okay. And what do you usually drink? I just drink a glass of wine at night, which helps me relax. Okay. And do you smoke cigarettes? I don't. No. Okay. And do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana? No, I don't. Okay. All right. So, that's all the questions I have. And just to clarify, does your pain come and go, or is it constant? Yeah. So, initially, it would come and go. But now, for the first two hours, it would come and go. And when I would have the pain when I was eating, it would come and go. But over the past six hours, it's just been constant. Okay. Great.
